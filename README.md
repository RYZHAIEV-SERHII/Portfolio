# `Portfolio`

This is my personal portfolio website built using **Python**, **Flask**, **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and
**PostgreSQL**. The site showcases my projects, experience, and skills, while also serving as a backend API for future
integrations.

---

## Features

- **Personal Portfolio**: Showcases my skills, experience, and projects.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for ORM and database management.
- **API Integration**: Built with FastAPI to serve endpoints for project data, projects, etc.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and admin panel to manage content.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Python**: Main programming language for this project.
- **Flask**: Used for the frontend web server to handle static content, templates, and some REST API endpoints.
- **FastAPI**: Handles the API layer for handling project data and dynamic content.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interaction with PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system used to store projects, blog posts, and other content.

### Frontend

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Markup and styling for the website.
- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity and improves the user experience.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures the site is responsive and mobile-friendly.

### Deployment & DevOps

- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure easy deployment and scalability.
- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy server for handling web traffic efficiently.
- **Gunicorn**: A WSGI HTTP server to serve the Flask and FastAPI applications.

### Testing

- **Pytest**: Unit and integration tests for the Flask and FastAPI backends.
- **Postman**: API testing and documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker** (optional for deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/RYZHAIEV-SERHII/Portfolio.git
     cd Portfolio
     ```

2. Set up the environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
- Add the necessary environment variables as shown in the `.env.example` file.

3. (Option 1) Install Python dependencies manually:

    ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

- Start the Flask server:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

- Start the FastAPI server:

    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --reload
    ```

4. (Option 2) Start the app using Docker:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
