Your plan is solid and covers a lot of ground in terms of showcasing your skills as a developer. Here are some
additional tools and frameworks that can make your project even more impressive and highlight your versatility:

### 1. **Task Queues and Background Jobs**

- **Celery**: For running background tasks like sending emails, generating reports, or performing long-running processes
  asynchronously. You could use this to automate tasks like data scraping, updating your portfolio content, or other
  background jobs triggered via your FastAPI endpoints.
- **Redis**: To store the task queue for Celery and also use as a caching mechanism to speed up database queries or page
  loads.

### 2. **Security and Authentication**

- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: If you integrate third-party login (e.g., Google, GitHub) to allow users (or
  yourself) to log into the site securely.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: You can manage authentication via tokens in your API, especially useful for the Telegram
  bot and any future mobile or client app integration.
- **Let’s Encrypt**: Free SSL certificates for HTTPS to ensure your site is secure.

### 3. **Frontend Frameworks and Tools**

- **React** or **Vue.js**: While Bootstrap and vanilla JS work well, adding a frontend framework like React or Vue.js
  can make your site feel modern and interactive, especially if you want to create more dynamic components or
  single-page application (SPA) features.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for quicker styling. It’s lighter and more customizable
  than Bootstrap.

### 4. **API Documentation**

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: FastAPI automatically generates an interactive API documentation using **Swagger UI**. Make sure
  to leverage it to allow others (or yourself) to test the API easily.
- **Postman**: You can use this tool for API testing and also generate API documentation from it.

### 5. **CI/CD Pipelines**

- **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI**: Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to
  automatically run tests, build Docker containers, and deploy to the cloud when you push new changes to the main
  branch.
- **CircleCI** or **TravisCI**: Alternatives for setting up CI/CD pipelines if you want to showcase your knowledge of
  different tools.

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Prometheus** and **Grafana**: If you want to monitor your application's performance and health, these tools help set
  up detailed application monitoring and dashboards.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: This is great for logging, especially if you deploy to AWS or Google
  Cloud. It will help in collecting and visualizing logs from the app.
- **Sentry**: For real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.

### 7. **Database Migrations**

- **Alembic**: A lightweight database migration tool that works well with SQLAlchemy. It allows you to version your
  database schema and handle updates seamlessly.

### 8. **Content Management**

- **CKEditor** or **TinyMCE**: If you want to manage content (e.g., blog posts) on the site, integrating a rich-text
  editor will allow easy formatting of text and media.
- **Wagtail**: If you want a more comprehensive CMS (Content Management System), this is a lightweight option that
  integrates easily with Python projects.

### 9. **DevOps and Deployment Tools**

- **Kubernetes**: You could explore container orchestration using Kubernetes, especially if you want to scale your site
  with more microservices or apps.
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure-as-code. It helps in managing cloud resources, automating the setup of servers,
  databases, storage, etc.

### 10. **Testing**

- **Pytest**: For unit testing your APIs and site functions. Combine it with **Coverage.py** to ensure good test
  coverage.
- **Selenium**: If you want to do automated browser testing for your site’s frontend to ensure responsiveness and
  functionality across devices.

### 11. **Data Analysis or Visualization**

- **Pandas and Matplotlib**: If you want to showcase any data science skills, you could include a section on your site
  where you visualize data in charts and graphs.
- **D3.js**: If you want to create interactive data visualizations in the browser (a good replacement or complement to
  Matplotlib in the frontend).

### 12. **GraphQL**

- **Graphene**: For a GraphQL API layer in Python. GraphQL could be an impressive addition to your REST APIs if you want
  to offer a flexible way for clients to query data.
